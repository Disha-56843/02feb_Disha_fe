Q : 1  What are the benefits of using CSS?

Ans.

	CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control the color of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, etc.

The following are the advantages of CSS :-

* Consistency
The main benefit of CSS is that style is applied consistently across a number of web pages. One command line can control several areas at one time, which is quite advantageous if there are changes that need to be made. You only need to alter one thing and the rest will follow. Because you donâ€™t have to change each page one at a time, web designers can be very efficient in creating and changing a website with only a few lines of code.

* Improved website speed
Web designers only need to use a small amount of lines of programming for each page. And if there are less code, there are fewer lines to read, resulting in a faster load time for every page. With online users not willing to wait for a website to load, improving site speed will be most advantageous. Owners who bank on website performance to improve search engine rankings and customer base will benefit from CSS.

* Easy to maintain
Cascading style sheet not only simplifies website development, but also maintenance. All the codes are placed on one page, which means making improvements or changing a few lines will not involve going through several pages. And since a change with a single line of code is applied across the website, maintenance time and effort are significantly reduced.
