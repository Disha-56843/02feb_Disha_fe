Q : 2 What are the disadvantages of CSS?

Ans.

	CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control the color of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, etc.

The following are the disadvantages of CSS :-

*  Come in different levels
There’s CSS, CSS 1 up to CSS3, which has resulted in confusion among developers and web browsers. One type of CSS should be enough. It would be preferable than having to choose which CSS level to use.

* Fragmentation
With CSS, what works with one browser may not always work with another. This is why web developers have to test for compatibility, running the program across multiple browsers before a website is set live. If only people use Mozilla or Chrome, but they don’t.

* Lack of security
Because it is an open text-based system, CSS doesn’t have the built-in security that will protect it from being overridden. Anyone who has a read/write access to a website can change the CSS file, alter the links or disrupt the formatting, whether by accident or design.
