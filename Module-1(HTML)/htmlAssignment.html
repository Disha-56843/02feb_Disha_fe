    <h4>Q:1 Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing?</h4>
    <h4>Ans.</h4>
    <h3>HTML Tags:</h3>
    <p>HTML tags are special keywords surrounded by a pair of angle brackets < tag keyword>. Most tags come in pairs, with an opening and closing tag. The closing tag is the same as an opening tag with the addition of a forward-slash. The closing bold tag looks like this < /b>. Some tags, like the tag used to display an image < img>, do not have a closing version. This is because you do not need to define an opening and closing to display an image, just a location of where the image can be found.
    </p>
    <h3>HTML Elements :</h3>
    <p>HTML elements are individual components of HTML defined by HTML tags. At first glance, elements and tags can easily be mistaken for the same thing. But they are not. The key thing to remember is that elements are made up of tags, but tags are not made up of elements.
    <h4> Element = start tag + content + end tag </h4>

    <h3>HTML Attributes :</h3>
    <p>In simple words, an HTML attribute is what modifies an HTML element. It is usually in the form of unique words that one inserts inside the opening tag. They control the behavior of the element.  Attributes are inside the start tag of that particular element that needs modification.

Void elements are used to represent elements that have no content and they cannot have any child elements. Void elements can have attributes. They are self-contained, and they don't require any additional information to be rendered correctly.Void elements in HTML are a special category of elements that are defined as having no content and no closing tag.  </p>

    <h4>Q: 4 What are HTML Entities?</h4>
    <h4>Ans.</h4>
    <p>HTML character entities are used as a replacement of reserved characters in HTML. You can also replace characters that are not present on your keyboard by entities.</p>
    <p>HTML entities provide a wide range of characters which can allow you to add icons, geometric shapes, mathematical operators, etc.</p>
    <b>For example:</b> if you use less than (<) or greater than (>) symbols in your text, the browser can mix them with tags that's why character entities are used in HTML to display reserved characters. <br><br>
    <b> Syntax: </b>

            <h4>Q:10 How can we club two or more rows or columns into a single row or column in an HTML table?</h4>
            <h4>Ans.</h4>
            <p>You can merge two or more table cells in a column using the colspan attribute in a <td> HTML tag (table data). To merge two or more row cells, use the rowspan attribute.</p>
                <b>How to use colspan attribute :</b>
        <p>If we wanted to combine the first two cells in the first column, we could use the colspan="2" attribute in the first <td> tag. The number represents how many cells to use (merge) for the <td> tag, the first cell spans the width of two columns.</p>
        <b>How to use rowspan attribute :</b>
        <p>If we wanted to combine the first two cells in the first column into one cell, we could use the rowspan="2" attribute in the first <td> tag. The number represents how many cells to use for the <td> tag, the first cell spans the height of two rows.</p>

            <h4>Ans.</h4>
            <b>Block Elements :</b>

            <b>Inline Elements :</b>
            <p>Inline elements occupy only enough width that is sufficient to it and allows other elements next to it which are inline. Inline elements don't start from a new line and don't have top and bottom margins as block elements have.</p>
